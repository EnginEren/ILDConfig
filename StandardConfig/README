 versions:
 ========

 -----------   
| v03-51-01 |
 -----------

    - fixed typo in documentation (current/README)

 --------    
| v03-51 |
 --------   
     -  bbudsc_3evt.steer: - removed detector model from steering file
     	-> use "Mokka -M ILD_Ox_v01" instead
     -  bbudsc_3evt_stdreco.xml:   added BCalReco processor for beam cal reconstruction 

 --------    
| v03-50 |
 --------   
     - switched examples/test steering files in current
       to use ILD_01_dev
     - updated current/README 

 --------    
| v03-00 |
 --------   

    added configuration files for CLIC CDR production (2011)

 --------    
| v02-02 |
 --------   
     - switched to use PandoraPFANew in the examples in ./current
     - made examples work with any detector model (ILD_00/ILD_01pre0) 
       (use Mokka -M modelName bbudsc_3evt.steer)
 
 --------    
| v02-01 |
 --------   
   - added ./current/README with mini user howto
   - added ./current/bbudsc_3evt_viewerDST.xml as example 
     for using the DSTViewer


 --------    
| v02-00 |
 --------   

   - added the directory "current". This directory contains: an stdhep 
        file containing 3 ttbar events; a Mokka steering file and related
        macro; the gearfile produced for ILD_00fw by running Mokka using 
        the included steering file; a Marlin Reconstruction steering file
        based on the standard configuration; the necessary energy 
        dependent pdf files needed by PFOID; and a Marlin steering file 
        which can be used to view the reconstructed events in CED.
        
    - this directory should be kept upto date so that it can form the basis
        of testing when producing releases.

    - when needed for mass production a suitible directory should be created
        in the same way as mc2008, which can then be modified during preparation 
        of a round of mass production and then "frozen "in order to preserve the 
        configuration. 

 --------    
| v01-01 |
 --------   
    * updated LCFI flavour tag (R.Walsh)
    - mc2008/: stdreco.xml, stdreco_IN.xml: - added parameters for the
      joint probabilities for ILD_00 in FlavourTagInputsProcessor; -
      fixed b3_D0CutValue = 5O -> 50; - using realistic V0Finder
      processor: h1_MCPIDEnable = false, in all RPCutProcessors.

    * included PFOID processor for calo based particle ID (plus
      necessary energy dependent pdf files)

    * use LCalDigi forBCal as opposed to MuonDigi 
      (layer decodes as "K" not "K-1")

 --------    
| v01-00 |
 --------   
  * updated to new ILD_00 detector
    - include LHcal, Bcal
	- latest Pandora steering
	- new number from SILC for SIT,SET,ETD and FTD resolution

  
 -----------
| v00-06-00 |
 -----------
 *  added FTDOnlyTracksMinimumHits=4  to Pandora steering

 -----------
| v00-05-02 |
 -----------
   * added mu+/-,K+/-,pi+/- decays to MCParticlesSkimmed collection

 -----------
| v00-05-01 |
 -----------
 
    * bug fix: renamed FTSelected_NJet to  Durham_NJet in MCTruthJetEnergy

 --------
| v00-05 |
 --------
    * added directory scripts
      -> python tool for creating steering files from template
         stdreco_IN.xml
 
 --------
| v00-04 |
 --------
    * Replaced FTSelected_NJets by Durham_NJets in DSTs (R.Walsh)

	* replaced FTDDigiProcessor w/ ETDDigiProcessor (same code)
	* included lcfi vertex charge processors							  
    * fixed TPC hit collection names
    * removed CurlKiller as processor 
      - now be included in LEPTracking (MarlinReco v00-08)
    * added example section for VTXNoiseHits (not active) (MarlinReco v00-08)

 --------
| v00-03 |
